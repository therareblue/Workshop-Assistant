burn image of ubuntu server 20.04 onto sd card
boot rpi
write network: {config: disabled} to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
write the following to /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml:
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  wifis:
    wlan0:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
      access-points: 
        "******":
          password: "**********"
then do:
sudo netplan generate
sudo netplan apply
reboot
wifi now works for me, and then you can do stuff like apt update and install a desktop and stuff

Enabling SSH
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install openssh-server

When prompted, enter your password and press enter to continue the installation
Once the installation is complete, the ssh service will start automatically. You can verify that SSH is working by typing:
$sudo systemctl status ssh


Unattended Upgrades
By default, Ubuntu is configured to install unattended upgrades. Thus, after the first boot you can get the error message regarding the cache log when trying to install apt packages. Just be patient and wait until Ubuntu upgrades.
However, if you wish to disable unattended upgrades, edit the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades file as sudo, and set these values:
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
