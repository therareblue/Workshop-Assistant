INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING THE RASPBERRY PI 4 BOARD
Note: You should install ubuntu, instead of raspbian, if you want to use Google Text To Speech (especially the wavenet high-quality voices).

Note: This is a copy of my notes made while creating my demo. It will be clarified and updated in more detail soon.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Burn image of ubuntu server 20.04 onto sd card
2. Boot rpi
3. Setting up wifi (note the ubuntu is without desktop environment).

write network: {config: disabled} to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
write the following to /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml:

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  wifis:
    wlan0:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
      access-points: 
        "******":
          password: "**********"
then do:
sudo netplan generate
sudo netplan apply
reboot
wifi now works for me, and then you can do stuff like apt update and install a desktop and stuff

---------------------

4. Enabling SSH
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install openssh-server

When prompted, enter your password and press enter to continue the installation
Once the installation is complete, the ssh service will start automatically. You can verify that SSH is working by typing:
$sudo systemctl status ssh


5. Unattended Upgrades
By default, Ubuntu is configured to install unattended upgrades. Thus, after the first boot you can get the error message regarding the cache log when trying to install apt packages. Just be patient and wait until Ubuntu upgrades.
However, if you wish to disable unattended upgrades, edit the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades file as sudo, and set these values:
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
--------------------------
6. All dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo pip3 install pytz
# sudo pip3 install requests
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt 
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

sudo pip3 install pvrecorder
sudo pip3 install pvrhino
sudo apt-get install mpg123
sudo apt install alsa-utils
 
sudo apt install python3-lgpio //this is for controlling gpis pins in ubuntu

7. Comands to control volume over terminal:

amixer -c 1 sset Mic Capture Volume 80%
Turns up the microphone level to 80%

alsamixer
sudo alsactl store
