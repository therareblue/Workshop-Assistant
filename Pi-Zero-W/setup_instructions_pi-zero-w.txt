Install all packages on workshop pi zero Matt

 1. set all interfaces on
 2. set wifi file:

In the boot drive create a new file called wpa_supplicant.conf
----
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=BG

network={
     ssid="your_network_name"
     psk="your_wifi_password"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
----

 3. set ssh on
 4: Installing Mosquitto MQTT Broker on Pi Zero W:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

sudo nano etc/mosquitto/conf.d/mosquitto.conf"

This will make a new file, configuring the mosquitto MQTT broker to work with other devices:
---
# Config file for mosquitto
#
# See mosquitto.conf(5) for more information.

user mosquitto
allow_duplicate_messages false

listener 1883
allow_anonymous true
---

 5. Installing dependences (MQTT Client, Sensor Libraries, camera):

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt

#sudo apt-get install rpi.gpio
sudo pip3 install pytz
sudo pip3 install bme680
sudo pip3 install mh_z19
sudo pip3 install picamera
#sudo pip3 install glob
#sudo pip3 install math
#sudo pip3 install json

 6. The Python script taking care of the sensor data and camera and send/receive MQTT messages as a client, also running on this Pi Zero W device is called "table.py". We need to make sure that the file will start on boot. The best option is to use "Systemd" service. Setting up the service:
- We create a new service called "aloha". This name was the first that popped into my mind, but you are free to use any name.
 

cd /etc/systemd/system/
Sudo nano aloha.service
---
[Unit]
   Description=aloha
   Wants=network-online.target
   After=network-online.target
[Service]
   Type=idle
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/workshop
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 table.py
[Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
---

sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/aloha.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable aloha.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Thats it. You are all set. Reboot and enjoy.
